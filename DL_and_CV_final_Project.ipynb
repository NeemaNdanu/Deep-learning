        "Many African cities face high accident rates due to poor traffic monitoring, reckless driving, and limited automated surveillance systems. AI-powered object detection can help monitor road accidents, detect traffic violations, and enhance public safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Project Objective:**\n",
        "Develop an object detection system using YOLOv5 or Faster R-CNN to monitor road safety and detect accidents, traffic violations, or potholes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Steps:**\n",
        "1. **Dataset**: Collect video footage from Kenyan roads or use open-source datasets.\n",
        "2. **Model Training:** Train YOLO or Faster R-CNN to detect vehicles pedestrians, and road accidents.\n",
        "3. **Evaluation:** Measure mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).\n",
        "4. **Deployment:** Implement in a real-time video stream for traffic analysis."

        "For my project, finding an annotated dataset—especially for African road traffic—was challenging. To overcome this, I created my own dataset. Below are the detailed steps I followed:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **STEP 1: FINDING A KENYAN VIDEO FOOTAGE ON ROAD TRAFFIC OR ROAD ACCIDENTS**\n",
        "I found video footage on Twitter from the Ma3Route account, which reports on road accidents in Kenya. The accident in the video occurred at 2:27, but no location was mentioned. However, the tweet tagging @ntsa_kenya (National Transport and Safety Authority) and @PoliceKE (Kenya Police) confirmed it was from Kenya.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tweet accompanying the video stated:\n",
        "\n",
        "**14:27 @ntsa_kenya@PoliceKE when will this stupidity ever end ? Bodas should get comprehensive insurance or just be removed from the roads completely. If you cant follow simple road rules why get in the road in the first place .   via @apachegan**\n",
        "\n",
        "I downloaded the video to proceed to the next step.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **STEP 2: CREATING FRAMES FROM THE VIDEO**\n",
        "To extract frames from the video, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1. Install Thonny on your laptop and install the necessary packages:\n",
        "          - opencv\n",
        "          - labelImg\n",
        "          - pytorch\n",
        "\n",
        "     2. Use OpenCV to extract frames from the video (run the code in Thonny). The process does the following:\n",
        "         - Reads the video file (C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\DL and CV\\Road accidents 1 (1).mp4).\n",
        "         - Extracts frames and processes every third frame.\n",
        "         - Resizes each processed frame to 1080x500 pixels.\n",
        "         - Displays the resized frame in a window titled \"test window\" for real-time visualization.\n",
        "         - Saves the resized frame as a JPEG image.\n",
        "         - Introduces a 10-millisecond delay between frames.\n",
        "         - Allows manual termination using the Esc key.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **STEP 3: MANUALLY ANNONATE THE VIDEO**\n",
        "To annotate the frames manually:\n",
        "\n",
        "     1. Open Thonny, go to the system shell, and type\n",
        "          - labelImg\n",
        "\n",
        "     2. Load the folder containing the frames extracted in Step 2 and specify the directory where annotated images should be saved.\n",
        "\n",
        "     3. Select YOLO format before starting the annotation.\n",
        "\n",
        "     4.  Annotate each object within the frames and assign labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "     5. I classified my frames into four labels:\n",
        "           1: Car\n",
        "           2: Pedestrian\n",
        "           3: Motorcycle\n",
        "           4: Accident\n",
        "\n",
        "     6. Once labeling is complete, save the annotations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **STEP 4: CREATING THE TRAINING AND VALIDATION SETS**\n",
        "     1. Create a new folder named FreedomTech.\n",
        "\n",
        "     2. Inside FreedomTech, create two subfolders:\n",

        "\n",

        "     4. Zip the FreedomTech folder and upload it to Google Drive for use in the Car Crash Detection Project.\n",
