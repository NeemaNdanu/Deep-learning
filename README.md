## First Project
### Project 2: Real-Time Object Detection for Road Safety and Traffic Management
Context:
Many African cities face high accident rates due to poor traffic monitoring, reckless driving, and limited automated surveillance systems. AI-powered object detection can help monitor road accidents, detect traffic violations, and enhance public safety.

### Project Objective:
Develop an object detection system using YOLOv5 or Faster R-CNN to monitor road safety and detect accidents, traffic violations, or potholes.

### Steps:
Dataset: Collect video footage from Kenyan roads or use open-source datasets.
Model Training: Train YOLO or Faster R-CNN to detect vehicles pedestrians, and road accidents.
Evaluation: Measure mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).
Deployment: Implement in a real-time video stream for traffic analysis.
