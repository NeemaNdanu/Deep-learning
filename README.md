## Task: Train an object detection model on a given dataset and evaluate its performance. Compare its performance with other models trained on the dataset. [30M]
### Steps:

* Choose a dataset (e.g., COCO, PASCAL VOC, or a custom dataset).
  
* Select an object detection framework (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO).
  
* Train the model and optimize hyperparameters.
  
* Evaluate using precision, recall, and mAP.
  
* Compare performance with another model.

### ðŸ“Œ Deliverables:

* Trained model files
  
* Performance evaluation report
  
* Comparison with at least one other object detection model
